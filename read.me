Task: You are the owner of a retail website. You're planning on running a promotion on a laptop and you want to send emails out about it. However, you only want to send it to people that may be interested in it so as not to annoy people that aren't interested. You're looking to use your data about who clicked on similar emails in 2020 to help you predict which users may be interested in the promotion.
